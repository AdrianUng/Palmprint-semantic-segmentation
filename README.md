Paper:
Ungureanu, Adrian-Stefan, Shabab Bazrafkan, and Peter Corcoran. "Deep learning for hand segmentation in complex backgrounds." 2018 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE). IEEE, 2018.

# To do:
1. add Matlab scripts used for dataset augmentation
2. add Python scripts used for SPDNN training (Lasagne with Theano)
3. add description and how to use the scripts in (1) and (2).
